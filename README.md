## Web Service
The web service created is a flask application, which displays information and data pertaining to food allergies. 

The "Home" page is a greeting page to users who land on the web service. It provides a greeting and a brief summary of the application , it also directs users to visit the "About" tab to learn more about the application and data displayed on the application. The "About" page also contains a link, [foodallergy.org](https://www.foodallergy.org/living-food-allergies/food-allergy-essentials/common-allergens), which leads users to FARE's page about the 9 most common food allergens, containing details about the 9 allergens as well as more information pertaining to the topic of food allergies. 

The app has two pages worth of data, "Patients" and "Allergy Testing". The Patients page, displays data in a table format about patients who have previously tested positive for a food allergy to one or more of the top 9 most common food allergens that trigger an allergic reactionn according to the Food Allergy, Research, & Education (FARE) organization. The table's fields are: ID, First Name, Last Name, Date of Birth, and Gender. The ID is the primary key of the table, as each patient has their own unique ID.
